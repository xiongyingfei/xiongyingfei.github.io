        Two papers were accepted at ISSTA'18. <a xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" href="publications.html#ISSTA18a">Shaping Program Repair Space with Existing Patches and Similar Code</a> reports our newest attempt to increase the recall of program repair after our previous attempts (<a xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" href="publications.html#ICSE18a">ICSE18a</a>, <a xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" href="publications.html#ICSE17a">ICSE17a</a>) to increase the precision.

      </li><li><b>March 15, 2018</b> <a xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" href="publications.html#GI18">Learning to Synthesize</a> was accepted at GI'18. This paper proposes a framework for synthesizing a program that has a high probability in a given context.
      </li><li><b>December 15, 2017</b> Two papers were accepted at ICSE'18. <a xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" href="publications.html#ICSE18a">Identifying Patch Correctness in Test-Based Program Repair</a> utilizes two new heuristic rules to identify the correctness of generated patches. <a xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" href="publications.html#ICSE18b">Identifying Features in Forks</a> studies the problem of understanding forks and provides an overview of features in a fork. 
      </li><li><b>July 3, 2017</b> Our ISSTA'17 paper <a xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" href="publications.html#ISSTA17">Faster Mutation Analysis via Equivalence Modulo States</a> was rewarded ACM Distinguished Paper Award.
      </li><li><b>May 10, 2017</b> <a xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" href="publications.html#ISSTA17">Faster Mutation Analysis via Equivalence Modulo States</a> was accepted at ISSTA'17. Many program analysis tasks require to execute many similar versions of a program, including but not limited to mutation testing, generate-and-validate program repair, mutation-based fault localization, and product line testing. Our approach accelerates these analyses by sharing the redundant executions.

Following our previous attempt in our <a xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" href="publications.html#ASE15">ASE'15 paper</a> to increase the precision of defect repair (less incorrect patches), in this paper we try to generate precise patches for a more general category of defects: incorrect conditions.

Precision tuning is widely used in many applications. In this paper we identified a type of code where raising precision may lead to less accurate result.
      </li><li><b>April 2, 2016</b> We have discovered a mistake in the data presentation of our ICST paper "<a xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" href="publications.html#ICST16a">empirical evaluation of test coverage for functional programs</a>". Unfortuately, it is already too late to update the camera-ready version, so please download the corrected version <a xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" href="papers/ICST16a.pdf">here</a>. Compared with the published version, Figure 3 and Table II are updated, while all discussions and conclusions are the same.

PATL handles program transformation with many-to-many mappings with the idea of guided normalization. This completes our previous work on <a xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" href="publications.html#PEPM15">one-to-many program transformation</a>.
      </li><li><b>December 21, 2015</b> Our <a xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" href="publications.html#ICST16a">empirical evaluation of test coverage for functional programs</a> has been accepted at ICST'16. The paper presents the first empirical study on test coverage of functional programs. 
      </li><li><b>December 21, 2015</b> Recently we started a new project on compiler testing. The <a xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" href="publications.html#ICSE16">ICSE'16 paper</a> presents an empirical comparison of the mainstream compiler testing techniques, where we used a new method to measure test effectiveness to make the comparison possible. The <a xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" href="publications.html#ICST16b">ICST'16 paper</a> presents a low-cost test prioritization approach that has the potential of accelerating compiler testing, even for the non-regressional cases.
